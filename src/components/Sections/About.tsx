        Hi, I'm Leon, a highly motivated and passionate Front-End Developer with
        expertise in React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. I graduated in IT from
        Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a strong focus on creating user-friendly interfaces, I excel at
        developing dynamic web applications using React. I write scalable and
        maintainable code using TypeScript, and I leverage Tailwind to craft
        responsive and visually appealing designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passionate about UX/UI, I take great pleasure in creating beautiful and
        interactives interfaces that enhance the user experience. I strive to
        deliver seamless and engaging interactions, making sure each design
        element is meticulously crafted.
      </p>
      <p>Let's collaborate and bring your ideas to life!</p>
